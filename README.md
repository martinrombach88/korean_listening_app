**Korean Listening By Sentence**

Korean Listening By Sentence is an interactive repetitive listening application built using React, React Router and Material UI.

Built in collaboration with Andrew Rombach, this audio application catalogues individual audio segments from Talk To Me In Korean
audio course lessons. Users can play any sentence or segment of the audio script individually.
The courses are organised by lesson, with each lesson containing up to 10 minutes of audio, broken up into a paginated interface where
a user can play segments at their leisure.

The courses include optional changes to subtitles, with traditional English and English in the Korean word order, something
useful for those having trouble with the reversal of words when learning a language like Korean.

The website uses modular components to take audio files, passing information through props and using hooks like useState to populate the view.
